[00:02.08]My love
[00:05.28]Westlife
[00:07.97]
[00:08.76]An empty street,
[00:10.26]an empty house,
[00:11.91]a hole inside my heart
[00:15.32]I'm all alone and the rooms
[00:17.71]are getting smaller
[00:22.01]I wonder how,
[00:23.56]I wonder why,
[00:25.15]I wonder where they are
[00:28.62]The days we had,
[00:30.25]the songs we sang together
[00:33.29]Oh yeah
[00:35.20]And oh my love,
[00:38.60]I'm holding on forever
[00:42.00]Reaching for a love that seems so far
[00:47.82]So I say a little prayer
[00:51.16]And hope my dreams will take me there
[00:54.51]Where the skies are blue to see
[00:57.52]you once again,my love
[01:01.27]Over seas and coast to coast
[01:04.50]To find a place I love the most
[01:07.83]Where the fields are green to see
[01:10.80]you once again
[01:14.55]My love
[01:17.33]
[01:18.60]I try to read,I go to work,
[01:21.92]I'm laughing with my friends
[01:25.20]But I can't stop to
[01:26.96]keep myself from thinking
[01:29.88]Oh no
[01:31.90]I wonder how,
[01:33.50]I wonder why,
[01:35.15]I wonder where they are
[01:38.53]The days we had,the songs
[01:40.95]we sang together
[01:43.32]Oh yeah
[01:45.09]And oh my love,I'm holding on forever
[01:51.80]Reaching for a love that seems so far
[01:57.74]So I say a little prayer
[02:01.06]And hope my dreams will take me there
[02:04.40]Where the skies are blue
[02:06.85]to see you once again,
[02:09.55]my love
[02:11.20]Over seas and coast to coast
[02:14.42]To find a place I love the most
[02:17.86]Where the fields are green
[02:20.21]to see you once again
[02:23.57]To hold you in my arms
[02:26.83]To promise you my love
[02:30.21]To tell you from the heart
[02:33.52]You're all I'm thinking of
[02:36.93]
[02:45.36]I'm reaching for a love
[02:47.45]that seems so far
[02:50.26]So I say a little prayer
[02:54.48]And hope my dreams will take me there
[02:57.98]Where the skies are blue
[03:00.08]to see you once again,my love
[03:04.42]Over seas and coast to coast
[03:07.69]To find a place I love the most
